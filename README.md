# GOLD-MINE-PROBLEM-USING-DYNAMIC-APPROACH-
Dynamic Programming: 
We are using dynamic programming approach for solving this problem. 
This approach is an algorithm design method used when the solution to a problem 
can be viewed as a result of sequence of subproblems/decisions. It solves problems 
by combining solutions to subproblems. It is usually applied when subproblems 
overlap, i.e. when subproblems share subsubproblems. 
It is different from the divide and conquer approach as divide and conquer does 
more work than necessary by repeatedly solving the common subsubproblems 
whereas in the case of dynamic programming, the subsubproblems are computed 
only once and their solutions are stored in a table, avoiding the re-computation of 
the subsubproblems every time.
